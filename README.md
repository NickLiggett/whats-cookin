## Introduction
  - This project was a group assignment for Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Module 2.  We created a recipe website called What's Cookin'! When the browser loads, the user is taken to a home page where they can explore a recipe library, refine their search for specific recipes based on the tags or names.  The user is also able to add and remove their favorite recipes to a favorite recipes list.
  - A recipe card will load with the ingredients list, total cost of the ingredients and recipe directions.
  - HTML was written for the framework, CSS for personal styling, and Javascript for all functionality including DOM manipulation.

## Technologies

- Writing methods within the classes.
- Getting comfortable with Mocha and Chai while navigating class-to-class interaction.
- Frequent use of iterator methods.

### Challenges
- Understanding the overall vastness of this project since it is significantly more complex than anything we have done during this program.

### Wins
